The main model file is named “Catalysis_model1”, which includes all the experimental values corresponding to a single parameter level — for example, at 35 bar hydrogen pressure. This model was also used for data fitting by adjusting the experimental values, upper and lower bounds, and initial conditions depending on the parameter being studied.
The other two files are used for model prediction:
“Cata_Concentration_Prediction_Model” predicts the outcomes at different catalyst concentrations.
“T_Prediction_Model” is used to predict results at different temperatures.
